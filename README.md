# My Matrix Library

My Matrix Library is a powerful Rust library designed to provide efficient and flexible matrix operations. It aims to be a comprehensive solution for various matrix-related tasks, offering a wide range of features and functionality. Whether you're working with dense matrices, sparse matrices, or specialized matrix structures, this library has you covered.

## Key Features

- **Matrix Operations:** Perform common matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Both dense and sparse matrix types are supported, allowing you to choose the most suitable representation for your data.

- **Advanced Operations:** Take advantage of advanced matrix operations including transposition, determinant calculation, matrix exponentiation, and more. These operations enable you to solve complex mathematical problems efficiently.

- **Sparse Matrix Support:** Benefit from efficient handling of sparse matrices, which are particularly useful when dealing with large matrices with many zero elements. The library provides optimized algorithms for sparse matrix multiplication, scalar multiplication, transposition, and other operations.

- **Banded Matrix Support:** Utilize banded matrices, a specialized matrix structure where the non-zero elements are confined to a narrow band along the diagonal. This can significantly reduce memory usage and computation time for certain types of matrices.

- **Element-Wise Operations:** Perform element-wise operations on matrices, such as element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations enable you to manipulate individual elements of a matrix easily.

- **Memory Efficiency:** The library is designed with a focus on memory efficiency, ensuring that operations are optimized to minimize memory usage wherever possible. This is especially important when dealing with large matrices or limited memory environments.

- **Ease of Use:** My Matrix Library strives to provide an intuitive and user-friendly API, making it easy to work with matrices in your Rust projects. The library is well-documented, providing clear explanations and examples for each feature.

## Getting Started

To use My Matrix Library in your Rust project, simply add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
